# Test app

Hi, for now I just threw a small template of the future site. There i had problem with bootstrap(css style) one div overlapped another. Go is not finished

## Development

Getting Start:

- Open a terminal.
- Go to the folder where you want to copy the project.
- Copy the project with this command:

  ```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/ArsenVoar/Repo.git
  ```

- Go to the project folder:

  ```sh
  $ cd Repo
  ```

In order to run it locally you'll need to fetch some dependencies and a basic server setup.

- Install local dependencies:

  ```sh
  $ npm install
  ```

- Open the html file
